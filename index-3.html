        <b>Which Airports Have the Worst Delays?</b>
      </h1>

        <p class="title">
          Have you ever been stuck at an airport during a layover due to delays? Have you ever wondered if certain airports are worse than others? Using RITA flight delay information for U.S. domestic flights between 2003 and 2016, let's take a look:

          The percentage of on-time arrivals at the eight largest airports appear to fluctuate between 73% and 87% between the years 2003 and 2016. Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta were lagging behind the other large airport up until 2008-2009. Atlanta in particular seemed to improve after 2009. Let's take a deeper look into the data and break down the delays.

      <blockquote>
        <p class="delays">
          According to RITA, delays are categorized as National Aviation System, Late-Arriving Aircraft, Air Carrier, Extreme Weather, and Security delays. These are defined as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            National Aviation System (NAS): Delays and cancellations attributable to the national aviation system that refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.
          </li>
          <li>
            Late-arriving aircraft: A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight to depart late.
          </li>
          <li>
            Air Carrier: The cause of the cancellation or delay was due to circumstances within the airline's control (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            Extreme Weather: Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane.
          </li>
          <li>
            Security: Delays or cancellations caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Atlanta and Chicago had significantly more national aviation system delays than the other airports, although both have shown improvement and decreasing number of delays over the years. Chicago showed a large drop in aviation system delays after 2008, and Atlanta showed a significant drop after 2009. The jump back up in aviation system delays for Chicago in 2014 corresponds to the drop in percentage of on-time arrivals in the Average Annual On-Time Arrivals chart.
        </p>
      <section id="late"></section>
        <p>
          Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Fort-Worth showed somewhat higher late aircraft delays for most years, but the differences are not as significant as those for other delay types.
        </p>
      <section id="carrier"></section>
        <p>
          From 2003 - 2016, Atlanta has always had more carrier delays than the other large airports, with 2007 being the worst year.
        </p>
      <section id="weather"></section>
        <p>
          Atlanta had the highest number of weather delays, but since 2009, the airports showed similar performance in terms of weather delays.
        </p>
      <section id="security"></section>
        <p>
          The airports showed similar performance in terms of security delays. Overall, security delays are far more infrequent than other delay types.
        </p>
      <h4 class="text-center">
        <p class="conclusion">
          In conclusion, it appears most delays are attributed to the national aviation system. The original chart of on-time arrivals for the eight largest airports showed some variation in performance for Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta over the years. Looking at the data more granularly, the most significant differences between these two airports and the other six airports occurred at the national aviation system delay level, and overall on-time arrival rates are affected more strongly by national aviation system delays over other reasons for delay (e.g. carrier, weather, security).
